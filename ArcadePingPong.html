      <p>Pong has influenced the conception of future video games, such as the popular Atari racing game, Gran Trak 10, which was released in 1974. Pong was also one of the first games to be played with a joystick, a feature that was adopted by many other video games. In the early 1980s, several versions of Pong were released, such as the tabletop Pong game, the board game Pong, and the electronic version of Pong.</p>
